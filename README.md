Video games are cool. I remember the first time I ever saw one was at my father's workplace. I have lost count of the summers I spent in that lab since then. I almost want to talk about the tiny computer memories and the large floppy disks but that makes me feel old. Instead let's talk about some other numbers. The world market stood at about $120 billion last year, powered by a third of all humanity. This is an interesting sector because, like the rest of the tech industry, it's evolving quickly and in somewhat unpredictable directions. Smartphones brought with them a horde of developers and fickle users, who remove 4 of 5 apps within 90 days of installing them. And with bandwidth becoming 



it has a bunch of industry upstarts and tech veterans all vying for that

This makes sense. I can edit text here. Netflix is running The Office (US). And it's a fine fine Sunday evening!
I'm trying to explore github. It's not like I suddenly felt an urge to write random things with some version control thrown in. Maybe it was when I flipped through some old notebooks from ages ago. But it can be fun to look back and relive a feeling.

How do you value a game? 
DCF; value user engagement; value developers/team; platform risks - what if android/windwos goes down?
Zynga, pubg, monolith, blizzard


Getting to the point, I think I'll talk about a video game today. It's called Clash Royale, published in 2016 by Supercell. 
- Whoa! This just in:  It's the top grossing android app. Followed by Pandora Music, Candy Crush Saga. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/topgrossing?hl=en
- The company itself was setup in Finland, 2010. Posted a revenue of EUR 21.6bn in 2016. Good read here https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-supercell-results/clash-of-clans-maker-profit-up-despite-pokemon-challenge-idUKKBN15U15I. Their other hit is Clash of Clans at #13 today.

Anyhoo, CR has been a top 3 app for me in the past 3 months - the other two are work email and messaging. And I've often wondered how this came to pass. It's likely a combination of (1) a slick/engaging/(borderline addictive) UX; (2) that bit of time over the pot cannot be wasted now, 'can' it? <insert meme  here> (3) and how I've taken up a part time assignment as a couch potato!
  
Wikipedia defines CR as a freemium mobile tower rush game. It builds on the idea of a card-based RPG ("I play a Blizzard with 4 attack power against your Wizard of 3 armour and 2 health") by adding loot-box rewards and PvP gameplay. To unlock more and As you gain XP points  armies attack the opponent's tower and need to take it down before they destroy yours.  are attacking the enemy fort even as they

I bet Supercell employees'd be like the happiest people ever really. And imagine having such profound effect on this person living in an awesome flat in downtown Chicago (that's the longest I've ever talked at a stretch without mentioning my awesome apartment).
Last week CR changed noticeably a noticeable upgrade to the multi-player/clan features. 

How do a few people from a blah blah background set up a billion dollar company?
Dedicated people, into it, thinking along different dimensions/features, survivorship bias. How do you quantify what's engaging - arrange 10 ideas in increasing oder of profitabilty?

PUBG & rules of survival.
